Day 4 Part 2: From initial investigations Spirit seems like any other AI pilot. However, I found some locked off files that are usually able to be accessed. My concerns are growing. Maybe I have delved into something I shouldn't have.

Day 5: If Spirit was aware of my investigations yesterday they did not make it known today. More of the standard drills. I plan to do a few further investigations later on today, I will report on what I find.
