Day 3: Started the drills today. The technical drills were first, this was a surprise to me as I thought the drills would start with the basics. However, all seems to be in order. Maybe I was too quick to judge Spirit. 

Day 4: A day of rest today. Although Spirit is still trying to keep me busy. Several times we have gone off course. I have worked with many different  AI ship pilots over the years but none have been like this.
